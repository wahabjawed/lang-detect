#Detect the language From Very Short Strings [langBot]

[![Build Status][build-badge]][build-status]
[![Coverage Status][coverage-badge]][coverage-status]


## Whatâ€™s so cool about it?

1.  **langBot** is packaged with support for [17][standard] or [56][extended]
2.  **langBot** can detect the language from very short string.
3.  **langBot** is TfLite convertible so it is supported on mobile devices. 

(*) Based on the [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wahabjawed/text-dataset-for-63-langauges) extracted from TedTalks

Text data extracted from TED Talks in 56 languages was converted
 into its binary representation of 4 byte for each letter, utf-8 encoding. 
Using Tensorflow, I trained a deep neural network to classify language based on small input. 
I achieved 91% accuracy with mostly spoken 17 languages and 80% accuracy with all 56 languages.

The model is Tflite convertible, so you can perform offline language detection on mobile devices.

This program was developed to secure an SQLite database with multi-lingual data. These basic ciphers were selected to provide weak encryption without impacting performance.
There could be other ciphers that could provide stronger encryption without degrading performance. If you know one, don't be shy to make a Pull request :)

For making contribution:

1. Fork it
2. Clone it

```
    git clone https://github.com/wahabjawed/language-detection-mobile.git
